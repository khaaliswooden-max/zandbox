# Roadmap

Strategic timeline for Zandbox initiatives across research, federal contracting, and platform development.

---

## Vision

**2024-2026:** Establish foundational capabilities across AGI research, federal contracting, and zero-budget AI systems.

**2026-2028:** Scale successful prototypes to production, publish academic contributions, secure sustainable contract vehicles.

**2028+:** Advance toward transformative AI capabilities with established revenue streams and validated methodologies.

## Risk Factors

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Research gaps block RCA progress | Prioritize literature review, accept slower timeline |
| Federal opportunity timing | Maintain multiple pursuit tracks |
| Zero-budget constraints | Leverage open-source, community resources |
| Academic rejection | Iterate based on feedback, target multiple venues |
| Compliance failures | Build audit trails from day one |

## Review Cadence

- **Weekly:** Progress check on active phase
- **Monthly:** Roadmap adjustment based on learnings
- **Quarterly:** Major milestone assessment
- **Annually:** Strategic direction review

---

*"The mathematical impossibility of traditional digital transformation for resource-constrained organizations requires MVP approaches focused on specific bottlenecks rather than comprehensive overhauls."*

This roadmap reflects current understanding and will evolve as research validates or invalidates assumptions.
