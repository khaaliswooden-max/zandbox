# Federal Capture & Compliance

Methodology and resources for winning federal and SLED (State, Local, Education) contracts.

---

## Overview

Federal capture focuses on building sustainable government contracting capabilities through Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs), consortium mechanisms, and traditional procurement vehicles. The approach emphasizes compliance-first design with mandatory audit trails and approval gates.

---

## Contracting Vehicles

### Other Transaction Authorities (OTAs)

[VERIFIED] OTAs allow federal agencies to bypass traditional FAR-based procurement for prototype projects (10 U.S.C. § 4022).

**Advantages:**
- Faster time-to-contract (weeks vs. months)
- Flexible terms and IP arrangements
- Access for non-traditional contractors
- Pathway to production contracts

**Limitations:**
- Prototype scope only (initially)
- Agency discretion on usage
- Competitive landscape varies
- "Valley of death" between prototype and production

### SOSSEC Consortium

[VERIFIED] System of Systems Security Consortium (SOSSEC) manages OTA agreements for DoD cybersecurity and related work.

**Engagement Pathway:**
1. Membership application
2. White paper submission on opportunities
3. Proposal development (if selected)
4. Award and execution
5. Production transition planning

### GSA Multiple Award Schedule (MAS)

[VERIFIED] GSA Schedule provides pre-negotiated contract terms for federal buyers.

**Considerations:**
- Administrative overhead for small businesses
- Price negotiation requirements
- Compliance burden
- Long-term revenue potential

### Small Business Set-Asides

[VERIFIED] Federal law requires agencies to meet small business contracting goals.

| Category | Goal |
|----------|------|
| Small Business | 23% |
| Small Disadvantaged | 5% |
| Women-Owned | 5% |
| HUBZone | 3% |
| Service-Disabled Veteran | 3% |

*"Instrumental convergence principles apply across domains—diverse systems with different terminal goals converge on similar instrumental subgoals like self-preservation, resource acquisition, and capability enhancement."*

In federal capture: regardless of technical domain, successful contractors converge on relationship building, compliance infrastructure, and continuous pipeline development.
